This is an interactive program used to generate a business recommendation in the Boston area.
The user interacts with prompts to filter down business and eventually receive a personalized recommendation.
All business data was read from Yelp using the yelp_scraper Python script and saved to the various
csv files in this project. In order to use the most up-to-date data, regularly rerun the data
scraper to overwrite the prexisting csv files.

As the name implies, this project was born from me being bored in Boston :) This project was
purely for fun and I still regularly work on it... In other words, it's by no means "done" or flawelss!
